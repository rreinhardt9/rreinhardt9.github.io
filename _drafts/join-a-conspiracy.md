title: Join a Conspiracy
---

As a kid, what was more motivating; working on a list of chores you were handed or conspiring to bring a delicious prank or project to it's glorious finale?

When I was a kid I once got my hands on several giant wrapping paper roles and was determined to make a giant rocket out of it. The doubters just made me want to make it work even more. I was drawn in by a cocktail of feeling like maybe I shouldn't be doing this and the burning question of if I even could. After lots of work and planning, the 6 foot tall monstrosity rose majestically off of the launch pad and drifted down under parachute right into a neighbors tree where it stayed (creating many questions later if anyone was to discover the projectile hanging high in their tree). I and everyone else present were thrilled! It had worked! It felt dangerous! We didn't know if it would launch into the air or burst into flames we felt alive and in tune with the effort. Even if it had bust into flames, we had tried!

So what is it about a conspiracy like that can feel so engaging? Is there any lessons we can draw on how people feel motivated to do what they do?

I see a few key things that are at play when I feel engaged and delighted as a part of a conspiracy:
- I can actually have a direct impact in the outcome of the conspiracy
- I have the agency/ autonomy to contribute to the end
- It helps if it's risky and not a sure thing

## You can have a direct impact in the outcome

If you are too distant from having an impact, you aren't going to know if your conspiracy worked. What's motivating about conspiring to an end if you can't tell if you reached your end!

## You have the agency and autonomy to contribute to the end

This is the difference between "I'm building this because I was told to" and "I'm building this because we really want to do X and given the constraints I think building this might get us there". If you feel like you are just a cog in the machine, you may be contributing to the success of the organization but you can't "feel" it. The only things you see here are the carrot dangled in front of you or the stick brandished behind; neither of which are going to make you smile as you would as you bring your conspiracy to perfection. Not only that, but the carrot and stick wranglers are not going to be loving their job either.

## It's risky

You have the autonomy to contribute to the conspiracy, which means that you could be wrong. There are things at stake here and your decisions could make things an amazing success or fall flat. This can be incredibly motivating as you don't want to be the one to let your co-conspirators down! You're conspiracy came up with this approach and you want to see it work.

## Have you conspired today?

When I think of teams that I've really enjoyed working with, it contained elements of conspiracy. When you are conspiring, you aren't sitting on an assembly line waiting for things to come to you, you are huddling with your co-conspirators and plotting. There's camaraderie because you're forming plans together that you think will have an impact but we could be wrong. You need to remain flexible so that you can adjust your approach the moment you start to see you need to for the success of the conspiracy.
