title: How to Move Fast (and not slow down)
---


Build it right (so you aren't building tomorrows tech debt that will slow you down over time)
Keep it focused (focus on key value (desired outcome); Instead of saying "what is ideal" say "is this better than what we have right now"; set a time based "circuit breaker" to facilitate having hard conversations.)
  Collaborate (You can't move fast without clear lines of communication. Look at team size as a factor. All "fingers of the hand" at the table.)
Stay light (Your plans will have to change, so optimize to make change welcome and easy. Embrace change as part of the process, not as a miss from planning.)

# Build It Right
- Don't build tomorrows tech debt
- Balance between building for tomorrow and short sighted solving todays problem
- Only build what you need
- Ask if you would be OK if it was left the way you've built it.

# Focus
- What is the desired outcome?
- Don't go for perfect, go for better. Instead of asking "what is perfect" "ask is this better than what we have right now?"
- Set a circuit breaker to make sure you don't exceed your appetite.
- Think big, work small.

# Collaborate
- Clear lines of communication are essential to moving fast; team size for a project can effect this (diminishing returns)
- Collaborate in the moment of need instead of passing messages whenever possible.
- All parties at the table; no handoffs

# Embrace Change
- You will discover new information that will change your plans; this is good. Optimize for change.
- Stay light, make change easy in the way you plan projects
- Have a plan for how you will assimilate new information as a team during a project.
