title: Highlighting what's working

## What is working
- A great way to start is to try to end a day with at least one commit. Try to not go more than a few days without shipping something.
- Communication is key. Don't let processes and tools take the place of real communication.
- Collaborate early and often as a team and avoid "handoffs" in your workflow.
- Time box a project to 6 weeks and have conversations about adjusting scope as needed.
- Pairing is a great way to have shared context and reduce handoffs.
- Always ship tested well written code, cutting corners will bite you in the long run even if it seems quicker now.

## How did we get here

- Started with ending a day with commit
- Iteration and trying new things
- Found some ways of working that were both productive and felt good
- Noticed that it made our jobs easier. We didn't have to wonder where things were and we all had the information we needed when we needed it.
- Looked for tools to support our communication and collaboration

## What hasn't worked
- Make sure your tool of choice give you the flexibility to deal with change (we found this harder with tickets and spreadsheets)

## Where do we go from here
- How can we better share context and reduce handoffs with QA? The rest of the team?
